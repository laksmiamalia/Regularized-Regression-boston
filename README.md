Here I try to do regularized regression as part of weekly assignment for dibimbing Data Science Class Batch 16, with [boston](https://github.com/pararawendy/dibimbing-materials/blob/main/boston.csv) dataset. I compared between Ridge and Lasso methods, based on their RMSE, MAE and/or MAPE value. <br>

**Dataset Explanation** <br>
`crim` : Criminal Rate
`zn` : Residential land zoned proportion
`indus` : Non-retail business proportion
`chas` : Is bound with river
`nox` : Nitrogen Oxide Concentration
`rm` : Number rooms average
`age` : Owner age proportion
`dis` : Weighted distance to cities
`rad : Accessibility index
`tax` : Tax rate
`ptratio` : Pupil-teacher ratio
`black` : Black proportion
`lstat` : Percent lower status

## Goals for the Project 
Find out which one is the best for **BOSTON** dataset, **Ridge** or **Lasso**, based on their **RMSE** [Root Mean Squared Deviation], **MAE** [Mean Absolute Error], and **MAPE** [ Mean Absolute Percentage Error] value.

## Used Library
Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib
